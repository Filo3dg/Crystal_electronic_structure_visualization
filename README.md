# Crystal_electronic_structure_visualization
This repository is a collection of scripts that can be used to the output of electronic structures calcution done with the CRYSTAL program for quantum simulations of materials.

As of now only the script that allows to plot the DOS is available, in the future i will upload scripts for the visualization of 2D and 3D band structure and a tool that can be used different band structure.

The documentation for each script and input file example are contained in the pdf with the same name of the script
